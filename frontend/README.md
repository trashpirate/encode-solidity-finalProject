> This is the first iteration of a DApp that allows users to place bets on future price movement using an ERC20 token. A betting round is initiated by an administrator in the backend who determines the round end date and the expiration of the betting period. At the beginning of each round the price of a specific token (defined in the backend) is locked and then compared to the price at the end of the round. Users can place bets while the betting period is open which typically ends 1 hour or more before the betting round. 

> The user can connect their wallets which directs them to the correct blockchain. By entering their bet amount and using the buttons "Bet UP" or "Bet Down", tokens are sent to two different wallets that hold the tokens for each bet decision. The wallets are owned and managed by the administrators. At the end of each round, the administrator calculates the payouts based on the bet amounts entered during the betting period and transfers the tokens back to the users. In future versions, this will be automated in the backend or possibly even replaced by a smart contract.

> For this application to work you need also to install and run the backend (NestJS API): https://github.com/trashpirate/betting-dapp-backend
